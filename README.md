# JUnit 5

JUnit 5 is composed of several different modules from three different sub-projects.
## JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage
* JUnit Platform -> The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM. It also defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform.
* JUnit Jupiter -> JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the new programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5. The Jupiter sub-project provides a TestEngine for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.
* JUnit Vintage -> JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform.
